- RamenDAO - Key3D Project is a UseCase Project for DeStore

- zk is the Architecture.
- if zk, zk Logic has to be written in the Contract (Tornado Cash)
- Everything that deploys on Ethereum, deploys on Astar zkEVM
- **Backendwise we choose Foundry and Solidty for Key3D**

- Smoldot is out, because EVM.
- No reaction to zk Accounting, overengineered.
- No information about key3, asking organizer.
- Buisnesswise, hard times, goal is to survive.
- DappStaking sucesses are there but not easy to convince holders

**Todo**

- Follow up on realised Docs of Astar zkEVM (Frank)
- Follow up on good example dapp Staking Apps (Frank)

- cross contract call via xEVM
- _aftercomment Frank: ink is out_

**If solidity?**

- Small remix session.

- Truffle, Hardhat, Foundry
  - _aftercomment Frank: lets lock foundry ðŸ”’_

- cross contract call via xEVM
  - _aftercomment Frank: possible but waay to overengineered ðŸ”’_

### Implentation of Func Req.

| Funcional Requirment                        | Execution                                             | Notes                                                                                                               |
| :------------------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| WebApp allows you to see Ramen              | AR via [MindAR](https://github.com/hiukim/mind-ar-js) | focus on nice rectancles, simple and nice                                                                           |
| WebApp allows you to share your expierience | share Button                                          | inspect complexity of recording, share button complexity unkown, share button complexity guessed medium difficulty  |
| WebApp allows you to own your expierience   | ERC721 / PSP 22                                       | We use ERC721 and a Creator Pattern of 2 roles, at least that my first thought                                      |
| SmartContract handles Buisness Logic        |                                                       | no zk stuff neededd, just something is great. Expect something breaks, because testnet is super fresh, suuper fresh |
| SmartContract allows simple Accounting      |                                                       | Accounting can be super simple                                                                                      |

| Non Funcional Requirment | Execution                         | Notes                                                 |
| :----------------------- | :-------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| WebApp has a simple UI   | Rely on the Destore Design System | Simple is fine but is has to be nice, css is importan |

  - _aftercomment Frank: Super fresh everything is work in progress regardings zkEVM_
- Focusing on Frontend !?
  - _aftercomment Frank: Yes, good idea._
