- manager, marketing
- Vision: Enrich life in motion for those we serve
- yes definitly marketing guy üòÑ
- The Challenge: The automotive industry is lag behind the digitalization of consumers and the world
- The Challenge: Many challenges that hinder the excitement of the transportation experience
- Market has consolidated. yeap true, expect for emerging market, but they have no much money yet(my opinion)
- The brand itself holds the most value more and more, so they have to improve
- Oh he has son. He operates the ipad. I assume that made him happy.
- How he act based on that expieriences?
- Transportion should be fun.
- How to make mobility fun?
- web3 is by nature not so fun by nature, but culturwise not the worst choice.
- Had a internal Hackathon.
- Drive to Earn, Use for Fun?
- Seems like not just a slogan, they really mean fun. Good thing, my strong suite ü§§üêµ
- HA! Philosphy not the tech side, as expected
- mindthought: web3 has kind of club based culture, dao etc. clubs are mostly there for fun. People with common purpose come together.
- Very unique for Mazda, yes it is.

Q&A

- There is Takumi Sano. He seems like a geniue guy. Connected with Sota. As expected, the world is small.
- Ah Takumi Sano started with Sota this Hack.
- They know each other from college. Most likely they now my collegeu sota wannatabe who share the same name üòÑ
- Idea is important. Its the most important to be precise. Need a good video with a lot of smiles
- Does Mazda has web3 services? Nah i dont think so, lets see
- Decentralisation is key word for mazda. I don't think they have deeper understanding, but they see the strong movement.
- Alias young people 20-40 drive web3, they want this energy as well.
- Where mazda feels the potential?
- Speed is compeltly differnt. Normally they plan 5 years ahead. web3 doesnt even think a week forward, they just throw stuff out üêí
- I think the middle way is a good one.
- Do we have Data?
- No data is provided, mock that shit is my conclusion.
- Regulation of Tokens?
- no answer.

- 1. Can we distrubed that money which is created
- 2. DAO thinking is wild, likes it
- Global Buisness, challenge of japan. What are challenge in the US regarding mobility
- Safety(not really), ?? that was not really a answer, but ok^^
- Can be integrated in other automative.
- It don't have to be automotive at all. It allows a bigger market
- Ok the last one.
- What came up with the internal hack?
- Overlap is ok, Conculsion was it has to be fun. Get it its honest, not just marketing.
- Lets close.
- Last words, think broadly. Think out of the box. think freely.
- short break.
