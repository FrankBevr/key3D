### G'day ðŸ¦˜

I'm Josiah from Destore ðŸ•º.\
My role was to get the Idea of a Ramen Dao cross.

Frank and me scratched out multiple Concepts for the key3 Hack.
[See Notes](/Notes/Software-Design-3.md)\
We decided on the RamenDAO Idea.

Frank said to scratch it out, it could invole a bunch of hurdles.   
We don't know which technical hurdles we will encounter at this point.\
So we decided we sperate the Idea from technical Implentation.\
Frank gives his best to get something running.\
I give my best to communicate the Idea.\
For communicated I took over the Figma Part and the Video Part.

For Documenation sake, here are some details of my doing.
