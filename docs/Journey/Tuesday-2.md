### Dobrý den 🍶

So yesterday was Tuesday. I finished my Basic Setup Section. I encounter an
issue with ethers and their newer version 6 of the api. I wrote Ricmoo via
Discord and he responded in a hour, solved my issue right away.\
What a guy, love him < 3\
Big shout out to Ricmoo and his well maintained ethers project.
