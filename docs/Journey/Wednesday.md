### Namaskara ü•ò

Ok Today was Wednesday, I spendt most of the time to finsih the foundry thingy.
Now i know more and didn't had any trouble to get something running. 
When it comes to deploying on zkEVM from Astar I encoutered an Issue.
I think thats a quick fix.  
But for now I stick to local Deployment and Sepolia.

Now I have to decide what I will use for the Backend.   
Two things come in my mind.  
Use Deno and play with their Edge Deployment and KV Store or use Rust and sqlx.  
I will decided this after later. üêí

Oh right, somewhen i fix some vitepress things. Just remembered.^ ^
