### HyvÃ¤Ã¤ pÃ¤ivÃ¤Ã¤ ðŸ«¡

So yesterady was Wednesday. 
the progress is a bit to slow. But yesterday i fixed the deployment issue.
The issue was in the .mind file. It loads locally but it doesn't load on the deployment.
Yeah all what i did was fixing this bug. 

In the morning we had a call and there we add a bit of more structure to the docs. Added some files.
In the midday i found the bug. yeay.
