### Hoi üçú

Ok Yesterday was Tuesday. I searched a Starting point. 
I decided to go for the Smart Contract.  
In the past I had some issues with Foundry and to avoid it this time, 
I decided to start with a Recap of Foundry. 
So I added in the `./playground` Folder Foundry and followed the foundry book.  
Later I did some non related Validator Stuff, which turned out a mess, but quite fun nonetheless.
