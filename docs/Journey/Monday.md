### Hoi 🍜

Today, in the night I started to initalise some basic setup to get going.
Josiah is already running, I will add his stuff later in the Week.

I fell in a habbit, I organise things in a `./Organisation.org`.  
There I keep track of progress.

Tomrrow I will tell a bit more, currently I'm not in full writer mood.
