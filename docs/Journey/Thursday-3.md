### Sola â˜•

oh men yesterday was awful. 
I thought i fix the problem with the .mind file.  
But i just didn't. I excluded many options and thats was my third day to fix it. 
Later in the day, i was tinkering with a friend.
Now we have two Senior Devs tinkering.  
After hours and a bunch of tea, i had to pee obviously and we called it a day.

Now how i have to see how i manage it.
